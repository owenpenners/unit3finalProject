    <h1><strong> Conclusion and Final Decision</strong><h1>
      <h2> Conclusion</h2>
      <h3>In my opinion, I would not change my grade. I would consider the pros and cons of changing the person's grades but in the end I probably wouldn't change anything. <br>I wouldn't change anything because I don't want to change a grade that I have just so that I can get sent to prision when or if I get caught.<br> I also wouldn't change the other person's grade if it wasn't really needed because I would rather not get in trouble for another person's struggle with their grades.<br> If a person wanted me to change a grade. I'd just say to try harder in the class they are asking me to change. It's not that hard to change a grade from failing to passing. Especially if you have the motivasion of having your grade so far down the hole that you would be willing to resort to hacking to change it.
